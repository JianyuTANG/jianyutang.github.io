I'm currently an undergraduate student in School of Software, Tsinghua University, starting from August 2017. My major is Software Engineering and I'm interested in computer vision and machine learning. I have been starting my research work on machine learning advised by [Prof. Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/).

I'm also studying for a second major in Economics in School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, starting from September 2018 and my focus is Microeconomics.

Here is my [CV](cv.pdf).
